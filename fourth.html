            Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate
            change. It's widely recognized that to avoid the worst impacts of
            climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But,
            how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and
            individuals has been an endless point of contention in international
            discussions. This debate arises from the various ways in which
            emissions are compared: as annual emissions by country; emissions
            per person; historical contributions; and whether they adjust for
            traded goods and services. These metrics can tell very different
            stories. Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels
            <h3>
              How have global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) changed over
              time?
            </h3>
            In this chart, we see the growth of global emissions from the
            mid-18th century through to today. We see that before the Industrial
            Revolution, emissions were very low. Growth in emissions was still
            relatively slow until the mid-20th century. In 1950 the world
            emitted 6 billion tonnes of CO2. By 1990 this had almost quadrupled,
            reaching more than 20 billion tonnes. Emissions have continued to
            grow rapidly; we now emit over 35 billion tonnes each year.
            Emissions growth has slowed over the last few years, but they have
            yet to reach their peak. Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and
            land use change
            <h3>
              How have global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil
              fuels and land use changed over time?
            </h3>
            We see that while emissions from fossil fuels have increased,
            emissions from land use change have declined slightly in recent
            years. Overall, this means total emissions have roughly stabilized
            over the past decade.
