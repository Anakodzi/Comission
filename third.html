              Based on the annual report from NOAA’s Global Monitoring Lab,
              global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 419.3 parts per
              million (“ppm” for short) in 2023, setting a new record high. The
              increase between 2022 and 2023 was 2.8 ppm—the 12th year in a row
              where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by
              more than 2 ppm. At Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, where the
              modern carbon dioxide record began in 1958, the annual average
              carbon dioxide in 2023 was 421.08. Carbon dioxide concentrations
              are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are
              burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon
              that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis
              over many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the
              atmosphere in just a few hundred. Since the middle of the 20th
              century, annual emissions from burning fossil fuels have increased
              every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per
              year in the 1960s to an estimated 36.6 billion tons in 2023
              according to the Global Carbon Budget 2023.

            <h3>Why carbon dioxide matters</h3>
            <p>
              Carbon dioxide is Earth’s most important greenhouse gas: a gas
              that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which
              make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat
              radiating from the Earth’s surface and re-release it in all
              directions—including back toward Earth’s surface. Without carbon
              dioxide, Earth’s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to
              keep the average global surface temperature above freezing. By
              adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are
              supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global
              temperature to rise. According to observations by the NOAA Global
              Monitoring Lab, in 2021 carbon dioxide alone was responsible for
              about two-thirds of the total heating influence of all
              human-produced greenhouse gases.
